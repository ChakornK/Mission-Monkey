## 🚀 Requirements to play:

2. [9th Generation Intel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Lake#Coffee_Lake-S_(Desktop_processors)) Desktop CPU/[AMD Equivilent](https://www.cpu-monkey.com/en/cpu_group-amd_ryzen_3000-14)
3. A Graphics card that supports DirectX11 (Unless your computer is 20 years old, you have this)

> **Note**  
> These are the recommended system requirements to run this game. You can run this at a lower framerate on a less powerful PC

## 🐧 Linux Users:
You are on your own. If you want to, you can try and install Wine/DXVK to run the game. No documentation will be provided
> **Warning**  
> Any and all Issues that are specific to Linux will automatically be closed, as we do not (and (probably) will not) have native Linux Builds
## 🛠️ Requirements to Develop

1. [Unity 2021.3.9f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive#download-archive-2021)
> **Warning**  
> You must use this specific version to contribute to this repository. any pull request that contains a version older or newer than 2021.3.9f1 will be closed.

> **Note**  
> This project might be migrated to a newer version of unity at some point in the future, and the requirements to develop will change. make sure to read the README file before developing
2. [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community) with the "Game Development with Unity" workload

3. A somewhat decent Computer (Around 11th Gen Intel/Ryzen 5th gen with a NVIDIA 2000 series/AMD Equivilent GPU)
